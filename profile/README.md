## What we build

Lacak.io develops IoT-based systems to help fleets and operators:
- monitor vehicles and heavy equipment in real-time
- improve safety and compliance
- reduce operational cost through measurable telemetry
- turn raw device signals into actionable operational insights

---

## Solutions

- **Fleet Tracking** — real-time map, history playback, mileage & utilization
- **Fuel Monitoring** — consumption tracking, anomaly detection, optimization
- **Heavy Equipment Monitoring** — mining operations telemetry & productivity metrics
- **Load Monitoring** — payload tracking, overload prevention & maintenance support
- **Environmental Monitoring** — temperature / humidity sensing for cold-chain logistics

---

## Engineering standards

We build systems for real-world constraints: unstable networks, large fleets, and continuous data ingestion.

**Principles**
- Reliability & fault-tolerance first
- Observability-driven development
- Security baseline by default
- Performance-aware engineering

**Typical stack**
- Backend: REST APIs, async/event-driven services
- IoT: device protocol integrations, ingestion pipelines
- Data: relational + analytics storage (hot/warm/cold retention patterns)
- Frontend: dashboards, operator consoles
- Infra: CI/CD, monitoring, automated checks

---

## Contribution workflow

- `main` is always deployable
- `feature/*` for development
- PRs require: clear scope, testing notes, and production risk awareness
- CI blocks merge on: lint/typecheck/tests/build failures

---

## Security

Please **do not report security issues publicly**.

Use responsible disclosure via official channels: https://lacak.io
